# main.py
#
# This script serves as the main entry point for the Raspberry Pi Router Monitoring System.
# It orchestrates the collection of data from various sensors and network monitors,
# processes the data, and provides a consolidated output.
#
# The primary goal is to create a holistic view of the router's operational status,
# combining environmental data (like temperature, humidity, and physical obstructions)
# with network performance metrics (like signal strength and client connections).
#
# This refined version uses a central configuration file for settings and standardized
# data structures (dictionaries) from sensors, representing a more robust and
# professional software architecture.
