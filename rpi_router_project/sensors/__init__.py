# sensors/__init__.py
#
# This file marks the 'sensors' directory as a Python package.
# It allows the modules within this directory (e.g., ir_sensor.py, ultrasonic_sensor.py)
# to be imported elsewhere in the project, such as in main.py.
#
# By organizing sensor-related code into a package, we keep the project
# modular and easy to maintain. New sensors can be added as new modules
# in this directory without cluttering the root project folder.
