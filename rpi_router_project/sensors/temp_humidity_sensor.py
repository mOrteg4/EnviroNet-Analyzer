#
# This module simulates a DHT22 (or DHT11) Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
# Monitoring the ambient temperature and humidity is crucial for embedded
# systems like a router. Overheating can lead to performance throttling or
# even hardware failure. High humidity can also be a concern for electronics
# over the long term.
#
# This is a key "industry-relevant" metric to monitor, as thermal management
# is a major consideration in the design and deployment of networking hardware.
#
# This mock implementation will generate realistic temperature and humidity
# fluctuations.
